# Wearable-Haptic-Vision
Capstone project for UF CpE

# Project Architecture
"Wearable Haptic Vision" is a device that uses a wearable tactile display to inform the wearer about their surroundings by receiving object distance information. It will capture LiDAR depth information and utilize a Raspberry controller unit to make the wearable pressure grid waistband react according to an object's distance and direction.

# Completed Work 
- BLE reciever and Swift application connection
- Infalte/deflate valves for nodes
- Inflate/deflate Schematics w/ Rasperbery pi & modules
- Swift IOS application to interface with LIDAR
- Schematics and models for the vest & soft 3d-printed nodes
